# Nuxt Template

This template is an extension of the default nuxt starter template.
It enriches it with

- Nuxt UI (with some minimal default)
- i18n
- spellchecking
- eslint config
- typechecking

It uses `pnpm` as package manager.
`SSR` is deactivated.

Look at the [Nuxt documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.
